We’re pleased to share that our team has qualified for DEF CON Finals 2025 in Las Vegas.

After a challenging and rewarding weekend, we secured **6th place** in the DEFCON Qualifiers 2025, earning a spot among the top teams heading to the finals. The competition tested a wide range of skills across categories such as LiveCTF, reverse engineering, exploitation, and miscellaneous challenges. It required long hours, focused effort, and close teamwork.

This achievement is a meaningful milestone, but it’s only the beginning. We now shift our focus to DEFCON in Las Vegas, where we’ll compete on the global stage among the best cybersecurity talent in the world. We're looking forward to learning, collaborating, and pushing our capabilities even further.
