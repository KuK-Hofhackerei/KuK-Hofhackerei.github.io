We are proud to announce our success in the DEFCON Quals 2025!
Our dedicated team worked tirelessly around the clock to overcome the challenges presented throughout the competition.
We performed strongly across all categories—including LiveCTF, reverse engineering, exploitation, and miscellaneous challenges—securing our position among the top teams.

This achievement marks not the end, but the beginning.
We now set our sights on DEFCON in Las Vegas, ready to compete at the highest level.
